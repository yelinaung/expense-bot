## 2026-01-26 - Add status field to expenses table
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bfa99-5eab-7233-b180-cc878c77b38e
Task ID: 2
- Added migration to add 'status' column (TEXT, default 'confirmed')
- Added ExpenseStatusDraft and ExpenseStatusConfirmed constants in models
- Added Status field to Expense model
- Updated Create() to default status to 'confirmed' if not specified
- Updated GetByID() to include status field
- Updated GetByUserID() to filter by status='confirmed'
- Updated GetByUserIDAndDateRange() to filter by status='confirmed'
- Updated Update() to include status field
- Updated GetTotalByUserIDAndDateRange() to only sum confirmed expenses
- Updated scanExpenses() helper to include status field
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When adding columns, use ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS for idempotent migrations
  - List queries should filter by status='confirmed' to exclude drafts from user-facing views
  - Create() defaults status to confirmed for backward compatibility
